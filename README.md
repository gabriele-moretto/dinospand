# DinoSpand

The purpose of this board is to be mounted on a fertilizer spreader (an agricultural tool) to manage the drawer in which we load/unload the fertilizer.
While managing the tool, we'll see all the information in the cabin on the little OLED screen on the board, but also we will able to connect the device to our smartphone in order to managing some settings.

## Hardware

The microcontroller used is an ESP32-s3, which is useful for the right number of GPIO we need and for the bluetooth functions.
